			  <p>Provide accessible, sustainable energy to the general public by making solar technology available in public spaces to charge portable electronics.</p>

		  	<h3>General Overview</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Our goal is to implement solar cells in various public spaces and determine if the energy produced is both cost effective and actively used by the community.</li>  
			  	<li>We are considering several public locations to apply solar technology such as on outdoor benches, tables, buses, bus stops, blinds, posters, and airports.  We would like these to be locations where people actively gather and could use a ready energy source.</li>
				<li>We aim to provide portable electronics with energy that is readily available and sustainable.</li>
				<li>We aim to convert small energy savings into major energy savings as the community becomes more self-reliant and invested in environmental friendliness.</li>
				<li>We also aim to branch out of BYU and make an impact in public schools and cities.</li>
				<li>This initiative will also aid in decreasing pollution and increase the use of renewable energy resources.</li>
				<li>In the long run, this research will help developing countries around the world by providing them with sustainable energy to support their populations needs.</li>
